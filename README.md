 A parallax website is a design technique in which the background and foreground elements move at different speeds as the user scrolls, creating the illusion of depth and movement. This can add visual interest and engagement to a website, and can be used to create a unique and immersive user experience. Parallax design can be achieved through a variety of techniques, including the use of CSS and JavaScript, and can be applied to various elements of a website, such as images, text, and backgrounds. It's now widely used in the web design industry for creating engaging and interactive websites.
