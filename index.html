    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
      Jaipur has a long and fascinating history. The city was founded in 1727 by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II, who was a ruler of the Rajput state of Amber. The Maharaja wanted to build a new capital for his kingdom, and he enlisted the help of a Bengali architect named Vidyadhar Bhattacharya to design the city.

The city was planned according to the principles of Vastu Shastra, an ancient Indian science of architecture and design. The streets were laid out in a grid pattern, and the city was divided into nine blocks, or "chokris." Each chokri was devoted to a specific activity, such as trade, residence, or religion.

The city walls were painted pink, a color that symbolizes hospitality in Hindu culture. The tradition of painting the walls pink has been continued to this day, and the city is now known as the "Pink City."
